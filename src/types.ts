/**
 * cLaw Framework Types — Core type definitions for integrity protection.
 *
 * The integrity system implements Asimov's Third Law at the architecture level:
 * "You must protect your own continued operation and integrity."
 *
 * Three protection layers:
 * 1. Core Laws — Immutable, hardcoded, HMAC-verified. If tampered -> safe mode.
 * 2. Agent Identity — Signed after legitimate changes. External tampering detected.
 * 3. Memory Store — Signed after saves. External changes detected and surfaced
 *    to the agent, who naturally asks the user about them.
